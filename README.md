# Online retail sales 

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION
An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

Remember, thinking from the perspective of business leaders allows you to analyse the data more effectively and present better insights.

In this project, I drafted questions that was important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. I created a set of four questions that I anticipated each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. In total I created a total of 8 questions, 4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO. 

### CEO Questions:
**1.** What is the highest and lowest revenue-generating region?
This inquiry holds significant importance for the CEO, as it directly relates to the core income source of the business, namely, revenue. The CEO places great emphasis on revenue analysis, as senior management continually strives to enhance earnings. In this context, the CEO is keen to examine revenue figures across various regions to identify which regions are producing the highest revenue and which ones have lower revenue generation. By utilizing the gathered data and analysis, the CEO will be empowered to strategize ways to further augment revenue in the top-performing regions. For regions that exhibit insufficient revenue generation, the CEO will engage in a comprehensive examination to uncover the underlying reasons for the lackluster sales. Subsequently, efforts will be directed towards refining products to better cater to the preferences of these regions."
