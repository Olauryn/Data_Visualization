# Online retail sales 

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION
An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on whatâ€™s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

Remember, thinking from the perspective of business leaders allows you to analyse the data more effectively and present better insights.

In this project, I drafted questions that was important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. I created a set of four questions that I anticipated each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. In total I created a total of 8 questions, 4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO. 

## DATA VALIDATION



### Questions of interest to the CEO:
**1. What is the highest and lowest revenue-generating region?**

This inquiry holds significant importance for the CEO, as it directly relates to the core income source of the business, namely, revenue. The CEO places great emphasis on revenue analysis, as senior management continually strives to enhance earnings. In this context, the CEO is keen to examine revenue figures across various regions to identify which regions are producing the highest revenue and which ones have lower revenue generation. By utilizing the gathered data and analysis, the CEO will be empowered to strategize ways to further augment revenue in the top-performing regions. For regions that exhibit insufficient revenue generation, the CEO will engage in a comprehensive examination to uncover the underlying reasons for the lackluster sales. Subsequently, efforts will be directed towards refining products to better cater to the preferences of these regions.

**2. What is the monthly revenue trend, and which months have experienced the most significant growth or decline?**

Examining the monthly revenue trend offers the CEO valuable insights into the fluctuations in revenue over each month. This evaluation equips the CEO with the ability to assess how internal modifications within the company have impacted sales. For instance, the CEO can gauge how the launch of a new product contributed to a revenue surge in a particular month, or how the introduction of a new region boosted revenue for the online store. Additionally, the CEO can investigate if any internal delays have potentially caused a decrease in revenue. Such analytical examination holds great significance for senior management, as it aids in proactive planning and ensures a seamless customer experience and also notice significant fluctuationns or patterns that may require attention. 

**3. Which months generated the most revenue? Is there a seasonality in sales?**

In the realm of retail enterprises, certain months invariably witness heightened demand owing to seasonal patterns. Instances arise where data showcases consistent and foreseeable fluctuations that manifest on a recurring annual basis. Identifying these cyclically seasonal months becomes imperative as the CEO aims to formulate a strategy that optimally harnesses the potential of periods characterized by heightened demand.

**4. Who constitutes the leading customers and what proportion of the total revenue do they contribute? Is the business heavily reliant on these specific customers, or is the customer base well-balanced and diverse?**

Conducting this analysis holds paramount importance as it empowers the CEO to discern the primary factors driving the overall revenue. Examining the highest-contributing customers in the retail establishment offers valuable insights into which patrons are making the most significant revenue contributions. Subsequently, the store can formulate a strategic approach that tailors offerings to these top customers, ensuring a boost in revenue since these individuals are the store's prominent purchasers.

While having a smaller group of high-volume customers can be advantageous for a business, it can also entail certain challenges. Retailers may find themselves with diminished bargaining leverage when dealing with these customers, given their substantial influence on the store's revenue. It is imperative to communicate to the CEO the level of customer base diversification, allowing proactive planning. In situations where the business heavily relies on a limited number of customers, the strategy would involve expanding the customer base and targeting additional clientele that can contribute substantial revenue to the store.


### Questions of Interest to the CMO:

**1. What is the proportion of customers engaged in repeat orders? Are their purchases consistent or diverse?**

This inquiry reflects the CMO's interest in comprehending the patterns within customer orders. The aim is to ascertain the percentage of customers who return for additional purchases. This analysis aids the CMO in understanding the extent to which customers exhibit repeat buying behavior. Armed with this insight, the CMO can devise strategies to engage these returning customers with tailored offers and products. Furthermore, an assessment of their subsequent purchases will provide the CMO with valuable insights into trending product preferences, allowing for the formulation of targeted marketing strategies.

**2. What is the interval between successive orders for repeat customers following their previous delivery?**

This assessment is aimed at discerning order frequency. It involves gauging the duration that elapses before customers place another order after their last one. The premise here is that customers who have recently made a purchase are likely to have the product fresh in their minds, making them potential repeat buyers. By capturing this data through analysis, the CMO can design a strategy to encourage recent customers to revisit the business and make additional purchases. For those customers who have not placed another order, measures can be taken to gently remind them of their previous interaction with the store. Incentives may also be employed as part of this approach.

**3.What is the accumulated revenue attributed to customers who have placed multiple orders?**

Revenue is a direct result of customers' expenditure on products from the store. Therefore, it's imperative to analyze the earnings generated from customers who frequently make purchases. This evaluation aids in identifying the monetary value generated by loyal customers. By understanding this aspect, the CMO can fashion tactics to motivate high-spending customers to sustain their repeat purchases. It's also worth considering that customers who made substantial purchases initially should be enticed to return for further shopping. This strategic approach ensures that high-value customers consistently contribute to the store's revenue growth.

**4. Who are the most frequent repeat customers, and what is their revenue contribution?**

An essential evaluation involves identifying the customers who exhibit the highest frequency of repeat orders and their corresponding contribution to the overall revenue. While some customers may place recurring orders for low-value items weekly or monthly, resulting in a relatively modest revenue contribution, others may only order twice a year but with substantial orders, significantly impacting the revenue. The management should ensure adequate stock availability to meet the demands of infrequent but high-volume orders during specific months. For customers with substantial order volumes but relatively lower revenue, incentivizing bulk purchases through discounts could stimulate more purchases and subsequently boost revenue.
